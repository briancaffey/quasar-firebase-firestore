# Quasar Application v1-beta Firebase & Firestore

> An opinionated example for firebase & cloud firestore integration: **WIP as of 19 FEB 2019**

> Please note, that in order for this repo to work you must register a new project in the firebase console, and then follow the instructions in the repo to add Quasar's DotEnv app extension, and create your .env files accordingly.

> If you do not register a project and implement your key you will see the index page render, but all subsequent functionality will not work and you will see an error in the console. This is what you'll see in your console.

Clone this repo:

`$ git clone https://github.com/kpapro/quasar-firebase-firestore.git`

`$ cd quasar-firebase-firestore`

`$ yarn`

The application should launch on localhost:8080, and from there just start following the instructions. If you're mostly familiar with Quasar & Firebase, just be sure to follow the instructions in the firebase setup for the use of the new Quasar app extension so you can implement your .env file with you Firebase API keys properly. Then after that feel free to poke around. Again, this is a WIP so there will be some discrepancies. I'll keep updating this over the next week.
